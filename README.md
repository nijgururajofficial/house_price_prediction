# Boston House Price Prediction 
## Introduction
This project aims to predict the prices of houses in Boston using machine learning. The dataset used for this project is the Boston Housing dataset, which contains information on various features of houses in Boston such as crime rate, property tax, and proximity to amenities.

This project is based on a very popular dataset "The Boston Housing Dataset"

I have used Google Colab for this project.
Jupyter Notebook can also be considered.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## Customization 

- You can change the parameters of the model in the train_model() function in order to improve its performance.
- You can also change the visualizations in the notebook to better understand the data and the model's predictions.

## Note
- This project is for educational purposes only and not intended for commercial use.
- Please make sure to use the appropriate license for any datasets or libraries used in this project.
- 
## Model Training and Evaluation
- Linear regression is used to train the model.
- The model is evaluated using mean squared error and r2 score.
- The model is able to achieve a good fit with an r2 score of 0.66

## Conclusion
- The model is able to make accurate predictions of median housing prices in Boston using linear regression.
- The features that have the most impact on the housing prices are LSTAT, RM, and PTRATIO.

## Future Work
- Try other models for comparison
- Use other dataset for comparison
- Experiment with different feature selections and feature engineering techniques to improve the model performance.
